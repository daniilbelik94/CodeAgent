# Learning Platform

This project is a learning platform developed using modern web technologies.

## Technologies

The project utilizes the following main technologies:

**Client-side (Frontend):**

* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router DOM:** A library for navigation in React applications.
* **Redux:** A library for managing application state.
* **Redux Thunk:** A middleware for Redux that allows writing asynchronous actions.
* **HTML:** Markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
* **CSS:** Stylesheet language for styling the appearance of web pages.
* **Webpack:** A module bundler for JavaScript applications.
* **PostCSS:** A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
* **Babel:** A JavaScript transpiler that allows using the latest JavaScript features in older browsers.
* **ESLint:** A JavaScript linter that helps maintain a consistent code style and identify errors.
* **Prettier:** A code formatter that automatically brings code to a uniform style.
* **Axios:** An HTTP client for making requests to the server.

**Server-side (Backend):**

* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment on the server.
* **Express:** A minimalist and flexible Node.js web framework.
* **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* **(Presumably) MongoDB:** A NoSQL database (based on the use of Mongoose).

## Running the Project (Assumed)

**Development:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/daniilbelik94/learning-platform.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/daniilbelik94/learning-platform.git)
    cd learning-platform
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (client and server):**
    ```bash
    # You might need to navigate to each directory separately
    cd client
    npm install  # or yarn install
    cd ../server
    npm install  # or yarn install
    cd ..
    # Or, if there's a common package.json in the root
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the client and server parts (depends on the settings in `package.json`):**
    ```bash
    # Try the following commands (or look at the scripts in package.json):
    npm run dev
    # or
    npm run start:client
    npm run start:server
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    yarn start:client
    yarn start:server
    ```

    You might need to start MongoDB separately if it's used locally.

**Production:**

Instructions for building and running the project in production mode will depend on the server configuration and build settings. This usually involves building the client-side and running the Node.js server-side.

## Further Development

To fully understand the functionality and architecture of the project, you need to:

* Examine the code in the `client` and `server` directories.
* Analyze the interaction between the client and server (API requests).
* Understand the data storage structure in MongoDB (if used).
* Familiarize yourself with the implemented components and pages in the client-side.
* Study the business logic handling on the server.
