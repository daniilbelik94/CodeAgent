        In real life, you rarely learn theory just for the sake of it. Usually, you look for specific information to solve a problem or complete a task, right? This module is built that way! It consists of a series of scenarios with tasks, from very simple to more complex.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Theory â€“ materials to help you complete the given task.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Quizzes â€“ interactive tasks to check your understanding of key points in the provided material. Quiz results do not affect your overall success as a student. Donâ€™t be afraid of mistakes in quizzes, as they are just one of the learning tools!
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Autochecks â€“ practice with autoverification, i.e., solving tasks in a special programming environment.
      </Typography>
